# 🔐 DLocker & VaultX - Desktop Security Tools

## Overview

Welcome to **DLocker** and **VaultX**, two lightweight desktop applications developed to enhance your data privacy and folder security. These tools are designed for simplicity, security, and full control over your data and directories.

## 🛡️ DLocker

**Functionality:**  
DLocker allows you to **lock any folder** on your computer so that it becomes inaccessible to others. Once locked:
- The folder cannot be opened.
- No files can be deleted or modified.
- It becomes completely protected from unauthorized access.

**How It Works:**
1. Open the DLocker application.
2. Choose the folder you wish to lock.
3. The folder becomes locked and inaccessible.
4. To unlock it, run DLocker again and choose the same folder.

🔁 *Same process is used for locking and unlocking.*

## 🔒 VaultX

**Functionality:**  
VaultX is a custom-built **text encryption and decryption tool**. Unlike standard encryption, VaultX uses a **unique character mapping** system—making the encrypted text unreadable by any standard decryption tool.

**What You Can Encrypt:**
- Plain text
- Numbers
- Passwords
- Sensitive data

**How It Works:**
1. Open the VaultX application.
2. Enter your plain text.
3. VaultX converts it to a secure encrypted format using your custom map.
4. Save or share the encrypted text confidently.

🛠 *To decrypt, simply paste the encrypted text back into VaultX and it will restore the original content.*
